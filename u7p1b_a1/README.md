#u7p1b_a1

CPSC 340 a1 for u7p1b.


This assignment includes four files:
1. code
2. data
3. doc
4. figs

In the code file, there are six .py files:
* [main.py](code/main.py): it is an edited version of the main.py;
* [decision_stump.py](code/decision_stump.py): it is an edited version with the inequality decision stump part completed.
* [simple_decision.py](code/simple_decision.py): it is the answer for the Quesion 2.3 in the [report](doc/a1.pdf) with if/else to realize simple decision function.
* [knn.py](code/knn.py): it is an edited version with the prediction function in the knn class completed. 
* It also contains [utils.py](code/utils.py), [decision_tree.py](code/decision_tree.py) which are unchanged.

In the data file, there are four data files which are unchanged:
* [fluTrends.csv](data/fluTrends.csv)
* [citiesSmall.pkl](data/citiesSmall.pkl)
* [citiesBig1.pkl](data/citiesBig1.pkl)
* [citiesBig2.pkl](data/citiesBig2.pkl)

In the doc file, there are files related to the report:
* [a1.tex](doc/a1.tex): the latex file of the report;
* [a1.pdf](doc/a1.pdf): the report of the assignment 1.

In the figs file, there are ten figure files in .pdf format:
* [q12visualize-unlabeled](figs/q12visualize-unlabeled.pdf): corresponding to question 1.2
* [q2_decisionBoundary](figs/q2_decisionBoundary.pdf): corresponding to question 2
* [q2_2_decisionBoundary](figs/q2_2_decisionBoundary.pdf): corresponding to question 2.2

* [q3_2_train_vali_errors](figs/q3_2_train_vali_errors.pdf): corresponding to question 3.2
* [q4_1_decisionBoundarywith](figs/q4_1_decisionBoundarywith.pdf): corresponding to question 4.1
* [q4_1_decisionBoundarywith_sc](figs/q4_1_decisionBoundarywith_sc.pdf): corresponding to question 4.1 with KNClassifier
* [q4_2_Decision_tree_boundary](figs/q4_2_Decision_tree_boundary.pdf): corresponding to question 4.2 (bigCity1 using decision tree)
* [q4_2_decisionBoundary](figs/q4_2_decisionBoundary.pdf): corresponding to question 4.2 (bigCity1 using CNN)
