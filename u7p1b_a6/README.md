# u7p1b_a6

This assignment includes three folders:
1. [data](data)
2. [doc](doc)
3. [figs](figs)

The work is done in the jupyter notebook and, the [report (a6-final)](doc/a6-final.ipynb) is included in the [doc](doc) folder.

The figures of results are saved in the [figs](figs) file.

After completing scaling features, selecting features and deciding hyperparameters, the best test result on test set is of 0.178 of error.


(notice: When I checked my result and re-ran the code just before the deadline, the Question 1.1 took too long time and there was no enough time to finish running it, I showed the result of it in the cell below the code. You can run it and get the same result.)
